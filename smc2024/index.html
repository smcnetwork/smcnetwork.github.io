<h3 class="noMargin">Immersive <strong>Sound</strong></h3>
<h3 class="noMargin">Immersive <strong>Music</strong></h3>
<h3>Immersive <strong>Computing</strong></h3>
<p>The quest for <em>immersion</em> is — quite literally — all around us, and it has been a significant driver of research and development in the academy, the industry, and within artistic communities in the past decades. But what makes an experience <em>immersive</em>?</p>
<p>Spatial sound quickly comes to mind, and it will be a very relevant part of SMC 2024, both in the paper and the music / sonic art sessions. But there is more to <em>immersion</em> than spatial sound alone:</p>
<ul><li>the timbral possibilities afforded by novel sound design and synthesis algorithms certainly play a big role in the envelopment of a sonic experience <em>(immersive sound)</em>;</li>
<li>the temporal development of musical discourse and performance can determine its ability to become, as T. S. Eliot famously wrote, “Music heard so deeply / That is not heard at all, but you are / The music / While the music lasts" <em>(immersive music)</em>;</li>
<li>new strategies to engage with digital sound and music, both on studio and on stage, can open new paths for involving human computer interaction <em>(immersive computing)</em>.</li></ul>
<p>All of these themes — and much more — will be addressed in <strong>SMC 2024</strong>: welcome to Porto!</p>

<h3>Call for Music & Sonic Art</h3>
<p>SMC 2024 welcomes Music & Sonic Art contributions that are related to the core topics in Sound and Music Computing research for the concert program during the conference week. Concerts, performances and installations during SMC 2024 will be programmed in the most appropriate space at or around ESMAE and live performances are specially encouraged.</p>
<p>The theme of this year's SMC conference is <em><strong>Immersive Sound, Immersive Music, Immersive Computing</strong></em>. Submissions emphasizing these topics are strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Music & Sonic Art from any genre and in any formats is invited for submission. All submissions will be peer-reviewed, but authors are not required to anonymize them: SMC 2024 applies a single-blind peer review. The review will happen in two rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is a single-blind peer review by the Artistic Committee, that will judge the quality and relevance of the proposal for the SMC conference.</li>
<li>On the second round, the Organising Committee will address the feasibility of the selected pieces and build the concert and installation programmes for the conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is thus very important that all submissions state very clearly the human and technical resources needed for each performance and installation, as well as which of those resources will be provided by the authors and which are expected to be provided by the host institution. ESMAE hosts state of the art audio equipment (including immersive sound systems), as well as musicians in various traditions and formations (from solo to symphonic orchestra).</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to explore, but of course not limit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live solo or ensemble: solo or ensemble performances that can be performed live, with or without the use of immersive audio and/or video technologies. A recording of the edited ensemble has to be submitted for review, however the accepted works will be performed live on-site.</li>
<li>Media-based performances: pre-recorded music & sonic art performances leveraging immersive audio and/or video technologies.</li>
<li>Installations: music & sonic art installations, with or without the use of interactivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions should be made using the <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SMC2024">SMC2024 Conference Management Toolkit's website</a>. The submission of the title, abstract, and complete list of authors should be done first, followed by the submission of the proposal and supplementary files:</p>
<p>Mandatory files (two PDF files, maximum size 20MB each):</p>
<ul>
<li>A submission proposal with description of the performance / installation in the form of program notes.</li>
<li>A detailed technical rider, which should clearly specify how long the performance will last and include the details of both technical requirements and setup times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementary files (up to five files, maximum size 500 MB each, using formats mp4, mov, wav, aif, flac, mp3, and pdf), which can be added using the option "Upload Supplementary Material", available in CTM's Author Console after the creation of the submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio / Audiovisual performance / documentation of the piece.</li>
<li>The score of the work (if applicable).</li>
<li>Other relevant files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Title & abstract submission deadline (strict!)</strong>: February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Music & sonic art submission (strict!):</strong> March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2024</p>
<p>After notification of acceptance, all participants have a chance to further edit the uploaded material to make a performance-ready submission. Only one submission per participant will be accepted. Please note the submission proposal is for informative purposes for the selection and will not be included in the conference proceedings. Artists must hold the copyright of submitted materials to be used in SMC2024.</p>
<p>Each accepted music submission needs to be covered by an in-person registration (student or full, as appropriate). If the authors of the music submission are already SMC 2024 paper authors and have registered for the conference, their music submission can be covered with the same registration. Kindly indicate in the submission form if the first author of a submission is a student author.</p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the SMC 2024 Music Chairs: <a href="mailto:AMSDP@esmae.ipp.pt">Ângela da Ponte</a>, <a href="mailto:dimitrisandrikopoulos@esmae.ipp.pt">Dimitrios Andrikopoulos</a> and <a href="mailto:ruipenha@esmae.ipp.pt">Rui Penha</a>.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://franciscagoncalves.com">Francisca Rocha Gonçalves</a></strong> is a researcher from Porto, currently living in Berlin. Recently worked on the AQUATAG project at the IGB Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. Has a background in biological sciences with a degree in Veterinary Medicine from ICBAS (University of Porto), a Multimedia Master in Interactive Music and Sound Design from FEUP (University of Porto), and a PhD in Digital Media from FEUP (University of Porto). The research focuses on acoustic ecology in artistic creation as a tool for environmental awareness concerning underwater soundscapes. Developing artistic artefacts that reveal the problem of noise pollution in underwater environments is possible to understand changes in vibration and particle motion, both vital components in aquatic life.<br>Combining interests in sound, technology, art and science, it aims to raise societal and environmental awareness through artistic practices and sound art. A great passion for biology and music led to a demand to find synergies between nature and sound. Bridging these two worlds, Francisca attempts to find new musical approaches, not only for musical compositions but also for live performances.<br>Presently is working for ICARUS, collaborating with Dr Johannes Goessling. ICARUS is an arts-science project that focuses on the photonic properties of diatoms and creates upscaled ice sculptures of their internal shells. Co-founder of the artistic collective Openfield Creative Lab. Co-founder of Ocean Soundscape Awareness project - ØSAW.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The <strong>School of Music and Performing Arts (ESMAE)</strong> is a national and international reference for higher education in arts. Located in the centre of Porto, ESMAE has an international standing, and offers customised and cutting-edge higher education programmes in music and drama.</p>
<p>Built in 1985, on the foundations of the former School of Music, this is one of the founding schools of the Porto Polytechnic. Today it features two departments - music and theatre - and a postgraduate programme in Dance was created in 2016.</p>
<p> ESMAE is home to the Helena Sá e Costa Theatre and to the Café-Concert Francisco Beja, and apart from being a space for creating and experimenting, it is the venue of over 500 art events annually. The ESMAE Symphony Orchestra, the ESMAE Baroque Orchestra and the ESMAE Jazz Orchestra, among many others, are often the performers in many of those events.</p>
