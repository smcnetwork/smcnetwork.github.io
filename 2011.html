        The goal of the SMC Summer School is to give an opportunity to young researchers interested in the field to learn about some of the core interdisciplinary topics of SMC, and to share their own experiences with other young researchers. This year the focus is on the embodied links between sound, music, and movement. Lectures and hands-on projects will explore this theme from several viewpoints, including novel sound synthesis techniques, multimodal interaction, music cognition, movement analysis and characterization.<br />
  All the materials (slides, code, pictures, teachers, students, ...) are available at the Summer School wordpress page: <a href="http://smc2011summerschool.sampl-lab.org" target="_new">http://smc2011summerschool.sampl-lab.org</a>

  			<strong>Main Lectures</strong>
  			<ul>
  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch1: The Embodied Link between Music and Movement</strong></dt>
  					<dd>Recent developments in Systematic Musicology put more emphasis on the link between action and perception in the experience of music. This is in line with the general trend in cognitive and neural sciences. The focus is on Embodied Music Cognition. Important are also the psychological and social aspects.</dd>
  				</li>

  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch2: Characterisation of Movement and Music and their Relation</strong></dt>
  					<dd>Although we argue in the previous chapter that music and movement are intimately linked, we take them now apart to study the features of each of them and to study how we can describe the linkages between them.The following topic will be Introduced: resonant and smooth motion, basic gestures, synchronisation and entrainment, the use of space and time, pulse and metrical structure.</dd>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch3: The Measurement and Registration of Music and Movement</strong></dt>
  					<dd>A presentation is made of the various possibilities to measure movement in and outside the lab. Accelerometers, Mocap systems, video and GPS and their raw presentation as data or avatar models will be discussed.</dd>

  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch4: Mathematical Tools for Movement Analysis</strong></dt>
  					<dd>In order to reduce the gigabytes of data obtained with the technologies described in the previous chapter to understandable models it is important to have good mathematical description and analysis tools. An important aspect is that the movements to music are very often quasi repetitive movements. Relevant recent methodologies such as Periodicity Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition will be introduced.</dd>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch5: Some State of the Art Music and Movement Studies</strong></dt>

  					<dd>Walking to Music, Dancing the Samba, Resonance and Synchronisation in tapping to music by young children and movements made by musicians are relevant examples of the research on Embodied Music Cognition from the IPEM.</dd>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					<dt><strong>Ch6: Applications</strong></dt>
  					<dd>Many people, today, have small but sophisticated equipment in their pocket that can present music and measure movement. This opens the floor for many 'apps' that can apply our knowledge on Music and Movement. We suggest to have a brainstorm on innovative applications.</dd>

  			<strong>Projects</strong><br />

  			In the two hands on projects the participants will measure movements related to music listening or music making, analyse it with one of the mathematical models and present a model rendition of the movement in order to get hands on experience with the contents of the more theoretical lectures. The students will be able to propose experiments in which they are interested or choose one of the ideas we present.

  			</span></em>

  			</h3>

  			<strong>Main Lectures</strong> <br />
  			Digital sound synthesis relies on a number of techniques that accumulated during the last decades. Together with methods for audio and musical analysis and classification, they form a corpus that answers almost every sound researcher's and music practitioner's question. Unless, tight interaction constraints come into play. Once no more than 15-20 ms are allowed to transform interactive inputs such as human control into accurate auditory feedback, much of that corpus melts and instead leaves the stage to ad-hoc solutions, subsuming hardware dependency, application constraints, and various trade-offs that inevitably limit the quality and scalability of the solution. Far from providing a systematic approach to SMC in conditions of continuous interaction, the lectures will survey the diverse questions that need to be answered during a sonic interaction design project, both inside and outside the music field:
  			<ol>
  				<li>Instantaneous Sonic Feedback: interactive musical and everyday sounds; </li>
  				<li>Critical Design and Technological Issues; </li>
  				<li>Case Studies in Musical Sound Synthesis; </li>

  				<li>Case Studies in Everyday Sound Synthesis.</li>
  			</ol>

  			<strong>Projects</strong><br />
  			<ul>
  				<li><strong>Natural sonic walking </strong>
  					<em>(Maurizio Goina - Conservatorio Tartini Trieste, Italy)</em><br />
  					The purpose of this workshop is the realization of an interactive installation in which the main idea is the exploration of the expressive potential of ecological sounds for gait sonification. The aim of such work is to stimulate the user’s sensitivity to ecological sounds through their embodiment, and, reciprocally, to enhance her/his proprioception through a continuous and interactive sonic feedback.
  					The EGGS system <a href="http://www.visualsonic.eu/eggs.html">Elementary Gestalts for Gesture Sonification</a> will be used for the sonification of the walk, this by recognizing elementary kinematic units. The system is implemented as a Max/MSP application and a Processing applet.
  					There will be three phases; theoretical and conceptual work, sketching, prototyping and realization.
  					On the first day students will be introduced to the conceptual background of the EGGS system, will go trough a brainstorming session and produce concepts and vocal sketches.
  					On the second day students will focus on sound design needed for the sonification of the walking, and will realize sketches in order to simulate the installation, by means of the EGGS system, graphics tablets and accelerometers.
  					On the third day students will work on a full scale installation, applying and calibrating sensors to their legs, video documenting the system at work and discussing the results.
  					An example of this type of installation is <a href="http://www.visualsonic.eu/sw.html">Sonic Walking</a>.
  				</li>

  				<li><strong>Effects of sound and vibration in augmented walking tasks </strong>
  					<em>(Stefano Papetti - University of Verona, Italy)</em><br />
  					In everyday life, auditory and tactile cues coming from the feet provide significant information about the environment. Recent trends in HCI, performing arts and gaming, consider the use of foot-based multimodal interfaces, whose applications include augmented reality, rehabilitation, critical labor environments, navigation aids and entertainment.
  					The purpose of this workshop is to let students investigate and experience the importance of auditory and tactile feedback in walking and other foot-related tasks.
  					One or more pair of instrumented shoes will be made available (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3P2lKVDMXk">here's a previous prototype</a>). Such shoes are provided with force sensors and audio-tactile exciters.
  					Moreover, we will make use of a sensing floor enabled by contact microphones, which can track a person while walking.
  					By interfacing such hardware devices with an <a href="http://www.soundobject.org/SDT">open-source software for sound synthesis</a>, students will be able to experience both auditory and underfoot tactile feedback simulating different grounds (from creaking floors to snow and mud).
  					After exploring this setup, we will start a couple of pilot experiments to investigate the cross-modal effects of sound and vibration in walking scenarios.
