  <h3><a title="acad_cour" name="acad_cour"></a>Course material</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Lectures:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Soundscape Composition: Documentation, listening, and creation using computers:</b> The World Soundscape Project (WSP) was established as an educational and research group at Simon Fraser University during the early 1970s, and documented soundscapes as part of an over-arching concern to draw attention to the importance of the sonic environment. R. Murray Schafer's definitive soundscape text, <i>TheTuning of the World</i>, and Barry Truax's reference work <i>Handbook for Acoustic Ecology</i> were outcomes of these early years, followed by Truax's publication <i>Acoustic Communication</i> that deals with all aspects of sound and the impact of technology. Inthe field of sonic design, the computer increasingly provides toolsfor dealing with both the basic material of sound composition, suchas granular synthesis, convolution and digital signal processing, and the creation of multi-channel soundscape compositions using recorded materials. Prof. Truax’s presentations will outline the background of acoustic ecology as an area of both scientific research and artistic endeavour, leading into a discussion of soundscape composition as an art form per se, ranging from the pioneering workof the WSP to contemporary compositional approaches to creative presentations of soundscape materials.</li>
              <li><b>Sound and music content processing</b>: The amount and availability of different media (professionally
  produced or user-generated content) is continuously increasing. This is profoundly changing the ways we interact with sound and music today and how we expect to do it tomorrow. Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a fast-paced multidisciplinary field of research where different long-tradition disciplines (such as e.g. Signal Processing, Information Science, Computer Science, Musicology) meet to empower these changes. This lecture will provide an overview of MIR research, we will look into ways to extract semantic information from a number of media (from specific audio signals to contextual annotations). A special focus will be put on surveying state-of-the-art algorithms and available systems for the automatic description of music audio signals from a musical perspective (focusing on musically-meaningful dimensions, such as e.g. rhythm, harmony, timbre). We will explore diverse uses of this step of information extraction, such as music search and recommendation, music signal transformations or real-time music performance.</li>
              <li>Sound recording: Not all the handheld recorders do the same. Not all the audio formats sounds equal. This lecture will provide the basic concepts of audio recording and microphone techniques to perform high quality recordings taking into account  different aspects such as directivity, stereo techniques and portability.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Projects:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Composition of Realistic and Interactive Soundscape:</b> The process focus on recording and annotation techniques to compose realistic virtual Soundscape using an MTG system for Soundscape interactive composition. There will be 4 phases: soundscape analysis and recordings, annotations and database creation, virtual soundscape composition, soundscape performance. The students will analyze on-site a target Soundscape, they will define relevant Sound objects, set-up and performs the recordings using shot-gun microphones. Then, in a second phase, they will annotate interesting segment through Sonic Visualiser, creating and preparing the soundscape database. Finally, they will creates the virtual SoundConcepts using the MTG system for Soundscape generation & composition, written in SuperCollider language. In the final performance the student will play the soundscape moving a listener around the virtual space and controlling the soundscape parameters defined during the annotations. The environment recordings will be held in acoustically interesting environment, such as the Cathedral, the Boqueria or St Antoni Marketplace, the Barceloneta beach, the kitchen of the Hostelería Hofmann school, a Factory. Note that when we speak about acoustically interesting environment we means both the sonic properties of the acoustic space (the Cathedral) and the scenographic properties of its actors: the presence of interesting sources producing a notable activity of aesthetically interesting sound events (the Marketplace, the Factory, a huge Kitchen).</li>
             <li><b>Augmented Soundscapes</b>: The capabilities of portable devices such as current generation mobile phones and media players is still severely limited in terms of computing power and storage space, such that only a subset of today's analysis and synthesis algorithms can be run in realtime. The goal of this workshop is to develop techniques and applications around the concept of augmented soundscapes according to the following assumption: What if we had available now the computing power of current desktop devices in a mobile package? Without the limitations of today's mobile technology, how would we design augmented reality applications? In this workshop we will create augmented soundscapes, starting from recordings of real soundscapes, that will be recorded by the participants during the first day of the workshop workshops. Using realtime machine listening techniques like onset detection, event extraction and segmentation, tempo tracking, etc. we will extract prominent features from real soundscapes. These features will be used to process and recompose the audio material with signal processing techniques such as granular resynthesis, concatenative synthesis, audio mosaicing and spectral modification. The processes to be developed by the participants can include --but are not limited to-- electroacoustic compositions, musically augmented soundscapes, auditory display and data sonification applications, etc. The goal of the workshop is to develop a single particular augmented soundscape in a small group, with the focus of presenting the results in a final concert or interactive performance.</li>
              <li><b>SMC Tales</b>: The goal of the 'SMC tales' workshop is to develop a mobile phone application for collaborative story telling. The phone will be used during the conference to extract from the visitors a story that they create together. The story is formed by adding a recording of a single sentence at a time. But before the story can be extended, the story teller is presented with the last five recordings in the story. They can then choose to advance the story in whatever way they want. After the new storyteller has recorded a sentence, he can transform his voice to a robot, a kid, an old woman, and other types of voices. When satisfied with the result, the recording, together with a picture of the storyteller, gps data, possibly any subjective annotations, is uploaded to a server. The resulting story can then be listened to by visiting the 'SMC tales' website.
  </li>
              <li><b>Tangilble interface for graph based music representation</b>: The purpose of this workshop is to build a tangible interface for the music representation used in radio freesound (<a href="http://radio.freesound.org" title="http://radio.freesound.org">http://radio.freesound.org</a>). In radio freesound, a music composition is represented by a graph where nodes represent sounds, and edges represent transitions between sounds. This representation is aimed at collaborative composition based on a shared repository of sounds (freesound). Collaborative work, on the other hand,  is one of the main applications of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). By representing sounds of the database as tangible objects, users will be able to discuss, manipulate and exchange compositions without the restrictions of a single-user computer interface. An example of this approach is tangible sequencer (<a href="http://www.tangiblesequencer.com/" title="http://www.tangiblesequencer.com/">http://www.tangiblesequencer.com/</a>). Before the workshop, participants will have recorded, edited, labelled and uploaded their sounds to freesound. These sounds will be used to develop and test the interface.</li>
